Work To Do
==========
 * Fix imports of snakeplan, instead place projects in the pythonpath
 * Move templates from the application to the project
 * View/Form for Logged Time (where is the relationship?) - bsmith
 * Some sort of menu layout static across all pages (make it a model/view for flexability?)
 * Header linking back to the main page
 * Authentication on the user pages.
 * UI Design -- HARDCORE BITCH
 * Installation docs
