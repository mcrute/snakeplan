SnakePlan
=========

SnakePlan is a web-based tool used to manage agile software development
projects. The general approach was taken from the venerable but aging and
unmaintained xplanner.

The concept was created by Mike Pirnat and Mike Crute at PyCon 2009.

SnakePlan is written in Python using Django.

The project is just getting started so there isn't much else to say just yet!
